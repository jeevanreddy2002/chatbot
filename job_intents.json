  {"tag": "Laws",
  "patterns": ["Who maintains the laws of cricket","What are the laws"],
  "responses": ["Law 1: The Scorers. There are two scorers who respond to the umpiresâ€™ signals and keep the score. \nLaw 2: The Ball. A cricket ball is between 8.81 and 9 inches in circumference, and weighs between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces in men's cricket. \nLaw 3: The Bat. The bat is no more than 38 inches in length, no more than 4.25 inches wide, no more than 2.64 inches deep at its middle and no deeper than 1.56 inches at the edge. \nLaw 4: The Pitch. The pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards long and 10 ft wide. \nLaw 5: The Wickets. The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are 28 inches tall. The stumps are placed along the bowling crease with equal distances between each stump. \nLaw 6: Covering the pitch. The pitch is said to be 'covered' when the groundsmen have placed covers on it to protect it against rain or dew. \nLaw 7: Intervals. There are intervals during each day's play, a ten-minute interval between innings, and lunch, tea and drinks intervals. The timing and length of the intervals must be agreed before the match begins. \nLaw 8: Innings. Before the game, the teams agree whether it is to be one or two innings for each side, and whether either or both innings are to be limited by time or by overs. \nLaw 9: The result. The side which scores the most runs win the match. If both sides score the same number of runs, the match is tied. However, the match may run out of time before the innings have all been completed; in this case, the match is drawn.\n Law 10: The over. An over consists of six balls bowled, excluding wides and no-balls. A bowler may not bowl two consecutive overs.\n Law 11: Scoring runs. Runs are scored when the two batsmen run to each other's end of the pitch. Several runs can be scored from one ball. \nLaw 12: Boundaries. A boundary is marked around the edge of the field of play. If the ball is hit into or past this boundary, four runs are scored, or six runs if the ball doesn't hit the ground before crossing the boundary.\n Law 13: No ball. A ball can be a no-ball for several reasons: if the bowler bowls from the wrong place; or if he straightens his elbow during the delivery; or if the bowling is dangerous; or if the ball bounces more than once or rolls along the ground before reaching the batter; or if the fielders are standing in illegal places. A no-ball adds one run to the batting team's score. \nLaw 14: Wide ball. An umpire calls a ball 'wide' if, in his or her opinion, the ball is so wide of the batter and the wicket that he could not hit it with the bat playing a normal cricket shot. A wide adds one run to the batting team's score, in addition to any other runs which are scored off it.\n Law 15: The wicket-keeper. The keeper is a designated player from the bowling side allowed to stand behind the stumps of the batter. They are the only fielder allowed to wear gloves and external leg guards. \nLaw 16: The fielder. A fielder is any of the eleven cricketers from the bowling side. Fielders are positioned to field the ball, to stop runs and boundaries, and to get batsmen out by catching or running them out. \nLaw 17: Appeals. If the fielders believe a batter is out, they may ask the umpire 'How's That? before the next ball is bowled. The umpire then decides whether the batter is out. Strictly speaking, the fielding side must appeal for all dismissals, including obvious ones such as bowled. \nLaw 18: Bowled. A batter is out if his wicket is put down by a ball delivered by the bowler. It is irrelevant whether the ball has touched the bat, glove, or any part of the batter before going on to put down the wicket, though it may not touch another player or an umpire before doing so.\n Law 19: Caught. If a ball hits the bat or the hand holding the bat and is then caught by the opposition within the field of play before the ball bounces, then the batter is out. \nLaw 20: Hit the ball twice. If a batter hits the ball twice, other than for the sole purpose of protecting his wicket or with the consent of the opposition, he is out. \nLaw 21: Hit wicket. If, after the bowler has entered his delivery stride and while the ball is in play, a batter puts his wicket down by his bat or his body he is out. \nLaw 22: Leg Before Wicket (LBW). If the ball hits the batter without first hitting the bat, but would have hit the wicket if the batter was not there, and the ball does not pitch on the leg side of the wicket, the batter will be out. \n 23: Obstructing the field. If a batter wilfully obstructs the opposition by word or action or strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat, he is out.\n Law 24: Run out. A batter is out if at any time while the ball is in play no part of his bat or person is grounded behind the popping crease and his wicket is fairly put down by the opposing side.\n Law 25: Stumped. A batter is out when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket, while the batter is out of his crease and not attempting a run. \nLaw 26: Timed out. An incoming batter must be ready to face a ball within 3 minutes of the outgoing batter being dismissed, otherwise the incoming batter will be out. \nLaw 27: Unfair play. There are a number of restrictions to ensure fair play covering: changing the condition of the ball; distracting the batsmen; dangerous bowling; time-wasting; damaging the pitch. Some of these offences incur penalty runs, others can see warnings and then restrictions on the players. "]
